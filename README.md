# Portfolio — Anshika (portpolioAnshika09)

A personal portfolio website showcasing projects, experience, and contact information. This repository contains the source for the portfolio site used to present work, skills, and ways to get in touch.

> NOTE: This README is intentionally generic so it can be applied whether the project is a static site (HTML/CSS/JS) or a frontend framework (React/Vue/Angular). Update the "Tech stack" and "Run locally" sections to match your actual project setup.

## Project overview
This portfolio is designed to highlight professional projects, skills, and background. It typically contains:
- A hero / landing section with a short bio.
- Project showcase with links and screenshots.
- Skills / technologies list.
- Resume / CV download link (optional).
- Contact form or contact links (email, LinkedIn, GitHub).

## Features
- Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Project gallery with descriptions and links to live demos / repositories.
- Easily-editable sections to add new projects or update copy.
- Simple deployment to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

## Demo
Add a link to a live demo here when available:
- Live site: (replace this with your site URL)

## Tech stack
Replace or remove items that do not apply to your project:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
- OR React (create-react-app / Vite)
- Optionally: Sass / Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap
- Optional build tools: Node.js, npm / Yarn

## Run locally

Option A — Static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS)
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Anshi09/portpolioAnshika09.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve with a simple static server, e.g. `npx serve`).

Option B — Node / framework-based project (React / Vite / Next / Nuxt)
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Anshi09/portpolioAnshika09.git
2. Change directory and install dependencies:
   cd portpolioAnshika09
   npm install
3. Run the dev server:
   npm start
   or
   npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:3000 or the port shown in your terminal.

(Adjust commands to match your actual project scripts in package.json.)

## Build & deploy
- Static: Copy the built files (or the repo contents) to your hosting provider.
- GitHub Pages:
  1. Build the site (if applicable): `npm run build`
  2. Push the build output to the `gh-pages` branch or configure GitHub Pages to serve from `main`/`docs`.
- Netlify / Vercel: Connect the repository and set the build command and publish directory (e.g., `npm run build` and `build/` or `dist/`).

## Project structure
Typical structure — adapt to your repo:
- README.md — project documentation
- index.html — main entry (for static sites)
- src/ — source files (components, pages, assets)
- public/ — static assets
- styles/ or css/ — stylesheets
- package.json — dependencies and scripts (if using Node)

## Customizing the site
- Update your name, bio, and profile image in the main content file (index.html or the main component).
- Add projects by editing the projects array / project section. Include title, description, technologies, screenshot, and link.
- Update contact details (email, social links) in the footer or contact section.
- For theme changes, edit CSS variables or the theme file (e.g., styles.css, tailwind config).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — whether fixes, new projects, or improved styling.
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add my change"`
4. Push to your fork and open a pull request

Please keep PRs focused and include screenshots or links for visual changes.

If you'd like, I can:
- Tailor this README to the actual tech stack in your repository (I can inspect files to determine whether it's static or React/Vite).
- Add badges (build status, license, demo link).
- Create a short CONTRIBUTING.md or Deploy instructions specific to GitHub Pages / Netlify.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will update the README accordingly.# Here are your Instructions
